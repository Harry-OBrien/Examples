#Try writing a little game in Python for yourselves.

#The game should contain:

#A player
#Two or more rooms
#Two or more items placed randomly in the rooms
#The player should be able to set his name at the start of the game, then navigate around the rooms using text commands such as 'North', 'East', 'South', 'West'. Each room should have a text description which is shown to the player when they enter that room. The player should also be able to pick up and drop items.
