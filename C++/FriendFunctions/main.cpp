//Normally, private members of a class cannot be accessed from outside of that class.
//However, declaring a non-member function as a friend of a class allows it to access
//the class' private members. This is accomplished by including a declaration of this
//external function within the class, and preceding it with the keyword friend.

#include <iostream>

//The MyClass class
class MyClass {
public:
  MyClass(){
    regVar = 0;
  }
private:
  int regVar;
  
  friend void someFunc(MyClass &obj);
};

//note how this isn't part of the 'MyClass' class
void someFunc(MyClass &obj){
  std::cout << obj.regVar << std::endl;
  obj.regVar = 42;
  std::cout << obj.regVar << std::endl;
